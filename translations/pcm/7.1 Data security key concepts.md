# Data security key concepts

We don talk small small about data security for dis course. Now, make we enter di mata well well. For dis lesson, you go learn:

- Wetin be data security?

- Wetin be data classification?

- Wetin be data lifecycle management?

- Wetin be data loss prevention (DLP)?

- Why data security dey important for organization?

## Wetin be data security?

**Data security** na di way wey people dey protect digital data, like database, files, and sensitive information, make e no enter wrong hand, make dem no change am, or destroy am. Di main goal of data security na to make sure say data dey safe, correct, and dey available. To do dis, dem dey use different methods like technical, administrative, and physical security to protect data from wahala like cyberattacks, insider threats, and data breaches. Some of di things wey dem dey use for data security na encryption, access controls, authentication, audit trails, and security policies.

## Wetin be data classification?

**Data classification** na di way wey people dey arrange data based on how important or sensitive e be to di organization. Di reason why dem dey do data classification na to help di organization sabi which data dem go protect pass and how dem go handle am. Di common categories for data classification na "public," "internal," "confidential," and "restricted" or "highly confidential." Once dem don classify di data, di organization fit put di correct security controls and access restrictions to make sure say di sensitive data dey well protected and dem dey follow di law.

## Wetin be data lifecycle management?

**Data lifecycle management** na di way wey people dey manage data from di time dem create or collect am until di time dem go delete or archive am. Di lifecycle of data get different stages like creation, storage, processing, transmission, archival, and disposal. Data lifecycle management dey involve setting rules and procedures for each stage of di data lifecycle, like how long dem go keep di data, who fit access am, how dem go back am up, and how dem go clean am. If organization manage di data lifecycle well, e go help dem save space, improve di quality of di data, and follow di law for data protection.

## Wetin be data loss prevention (DLP)?

**Data Loss Prevention (DLP)** na di technology, policies, and practices wey dem dey use to stop sensitive or confidential data from leaking, sharing, or entering wrong hand. DLP dey use content inspection and contextual analysis to monitor and control data wey dey move (like email, web traffic), data wey dem store (like files and databases), and data wey people dey use (like data wey dem dey access or work on). Di goal of DLP na to identify and block or encrypt sensitive data to stop data breaches, follow di law for data protection, and protect di organization name.

## Why data security dey important for organization?

Data security dey very important for organizations because:

- **Protection of Sensitive Information**: Organizations dey keep sensitive data like customer records, intellectual property, financial data, and employee information. Data security dey protect dis kind data from people wey no suppose see am or thief am.

- **Compliance**: Many industries and places get strict laws about data protection and privacy. Data security dey help organizations follow dis laws, avoid wahala, and protect their name.

- **Prevention of Data Breaches**: If data leak, e fit cause money loss, spoil di organization name, and bring legal wahala. Good data security dey help stop data breaches or reduce di damage.

- **Preservation of Trust**: Customers and stakeholders dey trust organizations with their data. If data security fail, e go spoil di trust. Strong data security dey help keep di trust and confidence of customers.

- **Competitive Advantage**: If organization show say dem dey serious about data security, e fit make dem stand out. Customers and partners go like work with organizations wey dey protect data well.

- **Operational Continuity**: Data security dey include things like data backups and disaster recovery plans wey go make sure say di organization fit continue work even if data loss or disaster happen.

- **Protection Against Insider Threats**: Data security no be only for outside threats; e dey also protect against people inside di organization wey fit mistakenly expose data or do bad thing.

In summary, data security dey very important to protect sensitive information, follow di law, stop data breaches, keep trust, and make sure di organization dey successful and maintain good name.
